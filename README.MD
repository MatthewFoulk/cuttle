## Rules

Read the rules for Cuttle on [Pagat.com](https://www.pagat.com/combat/cuttle.html)

## Installation

First, start by closing the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/MatthewFoulk/cuttle.git
```

I recommend using `virtualenv` for development:

- Start by installing `virtualenv` if you don't have it
```
pip install virtualenv
```

- Once installed access the project folder
```
cd src
```

- Create a virtual environment
```
virtualenv venv
```

- Enable the virtual environment
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

- Install the python dependencies on the virtual environment
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Start the game
```
python driver.py
```

Once these steps are successfully done, a new window will open with an instance of the
Cuttle game ready for you to play and enjoy!
